<h3 align="left">Motivation:</h3>
<p align="left">Almost all of us have been through the hardships of living alone, without our parents. We wanted to help with one of these hardships, by creating RentX‚ÄºÔ∏è
</p>

<h3 align="left">Why?</h3>
<p align="left"> We've been students before, and we feel how hard it is to live on your own. Back when we were students, we wished that we had the slightest bit of help, but we were all alone. Therefore, we have created RentX, to provide students with a little bit of help. 
</p>

<h3 align="left">What does it do?</h3>
<p align="left"> Have you ever wanted to iron your clothes, but then you find out that you forgot to bring your iron from home? RentX will help students rent some products near them that are vital for a cheap price, or even for free‚ÄºÔ∏è
</p>

<h3 align="left">What did we learn?</h3>
<p align="left"> As we started developing this project, we thought it was going to be easy, but it turned out to be one of the hardest things we've ever done. Though it was hard, we've learnt a lot of things. Teamwork was not as easy as the word itself sounds. One person wants something, but the other wants something else. It feels like that the best thing we got out with from this project, was how to work as a group, not just the technical stuff.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Why RentX?</h3>
<p align="left"> Although there are many social groups on social media platforms that one can use to rent stuff, there was no proper, direct way to do it. The search for the right group in itself was even harder than living alone. That's where Rentx shines, as it is direct to the point, no chating, no need to search for hours, you can just get that specific product you need, that's it‚ÄºÔ∏è
</p>

## Features:
- A renter can easily upload photos of the product to be shared.
- Products are divided into categories.
- Categories can be filtered to make it easier to find something.
- A search bar with auto complete to search for a specific product.
